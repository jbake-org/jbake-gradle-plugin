= JBake plugin for Gradle image:https://secure.travis-ci.org/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin.png?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin"]

This plugin allows rendering a site using http://www.jbake.org[JBake] directly from http://www.gradle.org[Gradle].

== Examples

A few of the sites that use the plugin and serve as a good example are:

* https://github.com/melix/blog
* https://github.com/danhyun/blog
* https://github.com/msgilligan/msgilligan.github.io
* https://github.com/antonmry/antonmry.github.io

== Usage

*This is work in progress*

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
      jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'me.champeau.gradle:jbake-gradle-plugin:0.3'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'me.champeau.jbake'
----

This will add a `jbakeBuild` task to your build, which will search for a standard http://www.jbake.org[JBake] source tree in
`src/jbake` and generate content into `$buildDir/jbake` (typically `build/jbake`).

There is also a `jbakeClean` task to delete the build directory content.

== Configuration
=== Plugin configuration

The default input and output directories can be changed using the `jbake` configuration block:

[source,groovy]
----
jbake {
    srcDirName  = 'jbake-sources'
    destDirName = 'output'
}
----
The generated output can then be found at `$buildDir/output`.

The Version could be changed too:

[source,groovy]
----
jbake {
    version  = '2.3.0'
}
----

The default is 2.4.0

=== Render Engine configuration

Jbake uses three engines. The library versions could be changed too:

[source,groovy]
----
jbake {

    pegdownVersion = '1.4.2'
    freemarkerVersion = '2.3.19'
    asciidoctorJavaIntegrationVersion = '0.1.4'
    asciidoctorjVersion = '1.5.1'
}
----

Notice the `asciidoctorJavaIntegrationVersion` and `asciidoctorjVersion`. Since Version 2.3.1 jbake has changed
to the asciidoctorj library.

This plugin handles this change internally. If you use a Version > 2.3.0 of jbake, the dependency switch to the new one.

=== JBake configuration
There are several options to configure http://www.jbake.org[JBake]. One is to have the regular `jbake.properties` file
into the source directory. The other is to use the plugin configuration block:

[source,groovy]
----
jbake {
   configuration['template.post.file'] = 'mypost.ftl'
}
----
